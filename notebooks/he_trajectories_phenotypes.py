# # HE Study: Trajectories and Phenotypes
#
# **What this notebook is for:** the Oct 6 plan was to plot Oura measures
# **before and after clinical events** (for example decompensation) for
# Adam. This notebook explains why that isn't possible with the current file
# yet, then does the two analyses we *can* do now:
#
# 1. **Trajectories (population level).** How do groups of patients (for
#    example decompensated vs. compensated) look across their 180 study days?
# 2. **Phenotypes (individual level).** Do patients fall into a few
#    recognisable "types" based on their own Oura patterns, and do those types
#    line up with their clinical labels?
#
# It builds on `deid_oura_data_exploration` (last week's notebook): same data
# file, same cleaning, same **night rest bout** sleep proxy.
#
# > 🔒 **Privacy:** the data stays on this computer. No participant IDs are
# > shown in charts. **Never commit an `.ipynb` with outputs.** Only this blank
# > `.py` version goes to GitHub.

# ## Part 1 · Why "before and after clinical events" isn't possible yet
#
# **What we wanted (JP, Oct 6):** line up every patient's resting HR, HRV,
# sleep and activity on the day of an event such as decompensation, an HE
# episode or a medication change, then compare the weeks before vs. after.
# That needs **when** each event happened.
#
# **What Adam's Sept 22 file actually has:**
#
# | Need | In the file? |
# |---|---|
# | Event **dates** (decompensation, HE episode, hospitalisation, med change) | ❌ No. `decomp`, `anyhe`, `anyOHE`, `ascites`, `he_meds`… are **one value per person**, measured at enrolment and copied onto every day. The check below confirms none of them ever changes within a person. |
# | A real calendar | ❌ No. Only `days_since_start` (study day 1–180). We don't know what day 1 is (enrolment? ring activation?). |
# | Sleep data (stages, total sleep, bedtime) | ❌ No. Only the 5-minute **activity** string, which we turn into a sleep *proxy*. Adam said on Sep 16 that **sleep regularity** was the strongest signal in cirrhosis, so this gap matters. |
# | Repeated labs (MELD, ammonia, sodium over time) | ❌ No. MELD and Child-Pugh are baseline only. |
# | Resting HR, temperature deviation | ❌ No. Only daily *average* HR. |
#
# **Where the event data could come from (from our meeting notes):**
#
# 1. **Adam's study database (fastest).** On Sep 16 Adam described the
#    dataset as linking Oura with *lab values, hospitalisations, PROs and
#    neurocognitive testing*, so the source tables likely have event dates.
#    **Ask for an event table keyed by `name` + `days_since_start`**, with
#    columns such as event type and study day. That keeps the data
#    de-identified (no calendar dates) and drops straight into Part 4.
# 2. **The EHR (Epic at Weill Cornell).** Admissions, paracentesis (ascites),
#    variceal bleeds, HE admissions, lactulose/rifaximin start and stop dates,
#    and repeated MELD labs all live in Epic. JP's Sep 29 demo showed the path:
#    a **SMART on FHIR** dashboard launched from the patient's chart only needs
#    the **MRN** to match wearable data held outside the EHR (JupyterHealth
#    Exchange). The Medplum demo already pulls labs straight from the EHR.
#    This needs IRB coverage (Diana and Henry being added to Adam's protocol
#    was a Sep 16 action item).
# 3. **More complete Oura data.** The full Oura export (Adam, Sep 16) has
#    nightly **sleep periods** with bedtime start/end, the 5-minute
#    sleep-stage string, temperature deviation and lowest HR, plus raw HR/HRV
#    files (20–30 GB). Timestamps are in GMT and must be converted to New York
#    time. Going forward, the Oura API or Oura's upcoming research platform
#    (Oct 6) could feed JupyterHealth Exchange directly, once the heart-rate
#    tagging issue JP raised on Oct 6 is handled (minute-level and daily values
#    are mixed in one table without the Open mHealth qualifiers that tell them
#    apart).
#
# **What we can do meanwhile:** compare groups by their **baseline** labels
# over study time (Part 3), find people whose measures **shift suddenly**
# (candidate events to check against real dates later, Part 4), and look for
# **phenotypes** (Part 5).

# ### Build the daily measures
#
# * Only **valid days** (`valid80 == 1`, ≥80% wear) are used for measures.
# * An average HR of **0 bpm** is a recording error and is blanked out.
# * **Night rest bout:** the longest stretch of "rest" in the activity string
#   between 6 pm and noon the next day. Breaks of up to 10 minutes are allowed.
#   This is our sleep proxy (see last week's notebook, Step 8b).
# * **Rest regularity (SRI)** is new, and closest to what Adam called *sleep
#   regularity*. For each pair of consecutive days, we check every 5-minute
#   slot: was the person in the same state (resting vs. not resting) at the
#   same clock time both days? SRI runs from **100** (identical days) through
#   0 (random) to −100 (exactly flipped). It follows the published Sleep
#   Regularity Index, applied here to Oura's rest/not-rest classes.

# ## Part 3 · Trajectories: how do groups look over the 180 study days?
#
# **How to read these charts.** Each line is a group's **median** across
# people, one point per study week. The shaded band is the middle 50% of
# people (the IQR). We average each person's week first, so someone with lots
# of data doesn't count more than anyone else.
#
# * **Lines that stay apart all the way** mean the groups differ at baseline,
#   not that something changed over time.
# * **Lines that drift** may mean the group changes over the study. Check the
#   **number of people per week** (thin grey bars). Towards week 25 fewer
#   people remain, so the right end is less certain.
# * Because `days_since_start` isn't anchored to any clinical event, these
#   are **study-time** trajectories, not "before vs. after an event".

# ## Part 5 · Phenotypes: do patients fall into "types"?
#
# **Idea:** describe each person with a few numbers from their own Oura data,
# then let an algorithm group people who look alike. This is the
# *"individual phenotype identification"* approach from Oct 6.
#
# **The numbers per person** (from valid days):
# * typical night rest (median) and how much it varies (SD)
# * typical rest midpoint (circadian timing) and its night-to-night spread
# * rest regularity (median SRI)
# * HRV, average HR and steps (medians)
#
# **The algorithm** is **k-means**. It puts people into *k* groups so that
# people within a group are as similar as possible. We first put every
# number on the same scale (z-scores, via `StandardScaler`) so steps (in the
# thousands) don't drown out SRI. To choose *k*, we try 2 to 5 groups and keep
# the one with the best **silhouette score** (how cleanly separated the
# groups are; closer to 1 is better).
#
# ⚠️ Clusters always "work". The algorithm will split any data. What matters
# is whether the groups **make clinical sense** and **line up with the
# clinical labels**, which is the table at the end.

# cohort, **red** = higher, and 0 = typical. For example a type with blue
# *night rest*, red *night rest variability* and blue *SRI* is
# "short, irregular resters".

#
# **PCA** squeezes the 8 numbers per person down to 2, so we can draw everyone
# on a flat map. People close together have similar Oura patterns. Colours are
# the phenotypes. If the colours form clear islands, the types are real
# separations. If they blur together, the types are more like regions of a
# continuum.

# (could this split happen by chance?). With about 100 people and several
# labels, treat anything under 0.05 as **"worth showing Adam"**, not as proof.
